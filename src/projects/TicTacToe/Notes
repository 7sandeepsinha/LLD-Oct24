Layered architecture

Controllers
Service
Repository
Models -- DONE

controllers -> first point of contact -> APIs
In the tictactoe, we dont have APIs, hence we will keep, methods to play the game inside the
controller.

Service -> logics for winner, draw etc.

repository -> since its not persistent, we dont need to store anything, hence no repo needed.


Strategy design ->
1. Bot difficulty
2. Winning strategy -> O(1)
