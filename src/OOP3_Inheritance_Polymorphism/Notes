Parent 3
Child 1

Final - Child -> 4
As we cant initialise all 4 attributes in the child class,
from the child class itself, we need to call both parent
and child constructor.

Initialisation is always top -> down, that means
Initialise parent then Initialise Child

Call to parent cons -> Call to child cons


The class that has the attributes owns the responsibility
to initialise them. IE, the constructor of that class would
initialise the attributes for that class.

Logic of initialisation of attributes always lies within
the same class.
